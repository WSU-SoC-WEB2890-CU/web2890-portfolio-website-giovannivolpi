            <p>
                Within the world of Web Developing, I wanted to extend my challenges and begin a new chapter in my career, Freelancing. I knew that this would be a big challenge, but it will pay off.

            <p>
                I first began talking to Mattia Vosti, a professional Swiss paraglider who has competing national and international races. He mentioned that he was in need of a website to advertise himself.

              <p>
                I started by creating color sheets, wireframes, and I had no idea how this website would end up. It was a tough set up, howeever, it turned out to be a successful one so far.
                <br>
                UX is definelty what helped me the most create this website in a more efficient and simple manner. Without certain tools (Figma, Adobe colors, etc.) this project would be way more difficult.

            </div>
            <div class="box">
              <p>After working on my UX/UI side of the project, I began coding it all out, with a total of 6 pages. The work is still yet to be finished. 
                <br><br> So far, the main components of the website are complete, the work is currently being put on hold due to 
                some current chnages with hte client and his paragliding career.

        <div class="container text-center section1 mb-5">
            <p>
                The biggest challenge was facing this new chapter. It is hard to be able to successfully accomplish a website in just a few days. It is definitely a struggle, but keeping a positive mentality and remembering what your professors taught you is the biggest support you will have in this work environment.
